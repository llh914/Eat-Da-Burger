# Eat-da-Burger

## Overview
    A burger logger application created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM. The app follows the MVC design pattern using Node and MySQL to query and route the data, and handlebars to generate the HTML.

## How It Works
- Users submit names of a burgers they would like to eat, and the burger is added to the "To Be Eaten" column -- waiting to be devoured.
- Each burger in the "To Be Eaten Column" has a "Devour" button next to it. When the user clicks the button, the burger will move to the "Already Eaten" column.
- Every burger, devoured and not yet devoured,is stored in a database.
