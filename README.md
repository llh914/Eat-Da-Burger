# Eat-da-Burger

## Overview


## How It Works
- Users submit names of a burgers they would like to eat, and the burger is added to the "To Be Eaten" column -- waiting to be devoured.
- Each burger in the "To Be Eaten Column" has a "Devour" button next to it. When the user clicks the button, the burger will move to the "Already Eaten" column.
- Every burger, devoured and not yet devoured,is stored in a database.
